    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple website created with HTML.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About</a></li>

This website consists of an HTML document with a head and a body. The head contains the title of the website, and the body contains a heading, a paragraph, and an unordered list with links.

You can use HTML to structure the content of your website and add elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. You can also use CSS to style the appearance of your website, and JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior.

To create a website, you will need to save the HTML code above in a file with the .html extension and open it in a web browser. You can also use a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and edit your HTML code.
